Assignment Overview

This project is a multi-part Bootstrap-based sidebar and navigation interface. It includes a registration form, a responsive navigation bar, and a collapsible sidebar that turns into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

I started with building a registration form using Bootstrap form components. This form includes fields for first name, last name, email, password, and a terms agreement checkbox. I used Bootstrap's grid layout to place the first and last name fields side by side and added validation classes for the email and password fields.

Next, I implemented a responsive navbar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections. I used Bootstrap utilities to ensure that the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. This included adding the appropriate classes to make the navigation bar fully mobile-friendly. I also focused on the sidebar and its styling. I created a collapsible sidebar that turns into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

Finally, I integrated all components into a cohesive interface. I ensured that the navbar and sidebar work together, and that the overall layout is fully responsive across different screen sizes.
